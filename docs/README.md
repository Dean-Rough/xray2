# Website Rebuild Prompt Generator (WRPG)

A specialized AI tool designed to generate hyper-detailed, Claude Sonnet-optimized prompts for precise website cloning through exhaustive web scraping.

## Overview

The Website Rebuild Prompt Generator (WRPG) is a Next.js application engineered with a singular purpose: to create comprehensive, pixel-perfect AI prompts for Claude Sonnet-based IDEs, enabling maximum fidelity in website reconstruction.

This tool is exclusively focused on:
- AI developers using Claude Sonnet IDEs for website cloning
- Technical teams requiring precise digital website replication
- AI research professionals exploring advanced web reconstruction techniques
- Developers seeking to create exact digital replicas of existing websites

## Current Status

**Version:** 0.1.x (MVP Development)
**Status:** 80% Complete - CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED

### âœ… Phase 1 Achievements
- âœ… Core Firecrawl integration with comprehensive error handling
- âœ… Claude Sonnet-optimized prompt generation engine
- âœ… Enhanced URL input mechanism with smart validation
- âœ… Resume capability for failed analyses
- âœ… Comprehensive testing protocol and quality assurance framework
- âœ… CRT-style retro interface with VHS aesthetics

### ðŸš¨ Critical Discovery: Package Quality Issues
**Package Quality Score: 2/10 - Currently unusable for AI reconstruction**

Through systematic testing, we discovered fundamental issues:
- **No screenshots captured** (BLOCKING) - Firecrawl API issues
- **No CSS extraction** (BLOCKING) - Only HTML with meaningless class names
- **Truncated component analysis** (HIGH) - Incomplete, unusable fragments
- **Elementor complexity** (HIGH) - Page builder markup too complex for AI

### ðŸš« Phase 2 Blocked
**Do not proceed until package quality reaches 8/10 and all BLOCKING issues are resolved.**

### Quality Assurance Framework
- Testing protocol with AI evaluation methodology (`docs/TESTING-PROTOCOL.md`)
- Automated quality checks via test runner (`scripts/test-package-quality.js`)
- Quality gates requiring 8/10 minimum score (`docs/QUALITY-CHECKLIST.md`)
