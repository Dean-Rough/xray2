# Roadmap: Claude Sonnet Website Rebuild Prompt Generator (WRPG)

This document outlines the strategic development phases for the WRPG, a specialized tool designed to generate hyper-precise AI prompts for website cloning using Claude Sonnet-based IDEs.

## Version 0.0.x - Foundational Architecture
**Current Status:** Completed

### Goals
- Define singular purpose: Claude Sonnet AI-driven website cloning
- Establish comprehensive scraping and documentation architecture
- Create minimal, focused development infrastructure

### Completed Milestones
- Refined project vision for AI-powered website reconstruction
- Developed documentation emphasizing Claude Sonnet optimization
- Established core technological integration strategy

## Version 0.1.x - MVP (Claude Sonnet Prototype)
**Status:** 80% Complete - CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED

### Goals
- Implement core Claude Sonnet prompt generation capabilities
- Create ultra-minimal user interface
- Develop exhaustive web scraping mechanisms
- Enable comprehensive data extraction

### âœ… Completed Milestones
- [x] Implement firecrawl deep scraping for maximum data capture
- [x] Create comprehensive error handling for scraping processes
- [x] Develop singular, focused URL input mechanism (enhanced validation)
- [x] Create Claude Sonnet-specific prompt generation engine
- [x] Develop AI-optimized documentation packaging
- [x] Implement resume capability for failed analyses
- [x] Establish comprehensive testing protocol and quality assurance framework

### âœ… CRITICAL ISSUES RESOLVED - Package Quality: 9/10
**v2.3.0 fixes have transformed packages into production-ready quality.**

#### âœ… BLOCKING Issues RESOLVED:
- [x] **FIXED SCREENSHOT CAPTURE** ðŸ”¥ - Screenshots now properly preserved from Puppeteer fallback
- [x] **FIXED CSS EXTRACTION** ðŸ”¥ - Eliminated invalid format errors, manual fallback working
- [x] **FIXED API ERRORS** ðŸ”¥ - Removed invalid 'cssContents' format causing 400 errors

#### HIGH Priority Fixes:
- [ ] **HANDLE ELEMENTOR COMPLEXITY** ðŸ”´ - Page builder markup is too complex
- [ ] **MULTI-VIEWPORT SCREENSHOTS** ðŸŸ¡ - Need mobile/tablet/desktop views
- [ ] **COMPUTED STYLES EXTRACTION** ðŸŸ¡ - Need actual visual properties
- [ ] **COMPLETE ASSET COLLECTION** ðŸŸ¡ - Missing fonts, CSS, background images

### Quality Assurance Framework Established:
- [x] Testing protocol with AI evaluation methodology (`docs/TESTING-PROTOCOL.md`)
- [x] Automated quality checks via test runner (`scripts/test-package-quality.js`)
- [x] Quality gates requiring 8/10 minimum score (`docs/QUALITY-CHECKLIST.md`)
- [x] Zero tolerance for BLOCKING issues

### Remaining Milestones
- [ ] Implement advanced performance and structure analysis

### âœ… PHASE 2 UNBLOCKED - READY FOR MCP INTEGRATION
**v2.3.0 has achieved 9/10 package quality. All BLOCKING issues resolved. Ready for MCP enhancement.**

### ðŸš€ NEXT: MCP Integration Phase
- [ ] **IMPLEMENT OFFICIAL MCP SERVER** - Integrate with real Firecrawl MCP when available
- [ ] **BATCH PROCESSING** - Activate parallel multi-page scraping
- [ ] **ENHANCED RELIABILITY** - Leverage MCP built-in retry and error handling
