# Changelog: Website Rebuild Prompt Generator (WRPG)

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file. This project adheres to a versioning scheme that reflects its development phases:

- **0.0.x:** Initial setup and planning
- **0.1.x:** MVP (Alpha) - Core functionality
- **0.2.x:** Enhanced functionality
- **0.3.x:** Advanced analysis and optimization
- **0.4.x+:** Production-ready features and refinements

## [Unreleased]

### Next Priority
- Fix BLOCKING issues: Screenshot capture and CSS extraction
- Achieve package quality score ≥ 8/10
- Proceed to Phase 2 development

## 0.1.3 - 2025-01-15 - Phase 1 Completion (80%)

### Added
- **Enhanced Error Handling & Resume Capability**
  - Exponential backoff retry logic (3 attempts: 2s, 4s, 8s delays)
  - Automatic Firecrawl → Puppeteer fallback
  - Resume API endpoint for failed analyses (`/api/resume-analysis`)
  - Structured error responses with actionable suggestions
  - Database progress tracking for failed scans

- **Claude Sonnet-Optimized Prompt Generation**
  - AI-specific prompt formatting and instructions
  - Component-first development workflow guidance
  - Technology stack recommendations based on analysis
  - Estimated rebuild times and complexity assessment

- **Enhanced URL Input Mechanism**
  - Sophisticated URL preprocessing and validation
  - Common domain pattern handling
  - Smart error messages for invalid inputs

- **Comprehensive Testing Protocol**
  - AI evaluation methodology (`docs/TESTING-PROTOCOL.md`)
  - Quick validation checklist (`docs/QUALITY-CHECKLIST.md`)
  - Automated test runner (`scripts/test-package-quality.js`)
  - Quality gates requiring 8/10 minimum score

### Critical Issues Discovered
- **Package Quality Assessment: 2/10** - Currently unusable for AI reconstruction
- **BLOCKING**: No screenshots captured (Firecrawl API issues)
- **BLOCKING**: No CSS extraction (only HTML with meaningless class names)
- **HIGH**: Truncated component analysis (incomplete fragments)
- **HIGH**: Elementor complexity (page builder markup too complex)

### Changed
- Updated frontend error handling with detailed error display
- Enhanced database schema with error tracking fields
- Improved MCP utils with retry logic and fallback mechanisms
- Updated documentation structure with testing protocols

## 0.1.2 - 2025-05-23

### Added
- Initial project setup and configuration
- Basic Next.js application structure
- Core documentation suite:
  - Product Requirements Document (PRD.md)
  - Architecture Document (ARCHITECTURE.md)
  - Changelog (CHANGELOG.md)
  - Development Guide (DEVELOPMENT.md)
  - README (README.md)
  - Roadmap (ROADMAP.md)

### Changed
- Project name from generic "AI Website Analyzer" to "Website Rebuild Prompt Generator (WRPG)"
- Unified documentation style across all files
- Improved versioning scheme to better reflect development phases

## 0.1.2 - 2025-05-23

### Fixed
- Async/await in forEach loops causing Vercel build failures in `generate-docs.ts`
- Local Vercel project linking for manual deployments

### Added
- Comprehensive error logging to `data-processing.ts` for production debugging
- Enhanced error handling and status reporting throughout the application

### Changed
- **Status**: Application now fully deployed and operational
- **Deployment URL**: Updated to latest working deployment at `https://xray-py6rfm99p-dean-roughs-projects.vercel.app`
- Environment variables confirmed working in Vercel production environment

### Deployment
- ✅ **DEPLOYED & WORKING**: All fixes applied successfully
- ✅ **Environment Variables**: All confirmed operational in Vercel
- ✅ **Build Process**: Clean deployment with no errors
- ✅ **Error Logging**: Production debugging capabilities in place

## 0.1.1 - 2025-05-23

### Fixed
- **Build Error**: Fixed async/await usage in non-async forEach callbacks in `lib/generate-docs.ts`
  - Converted `forEach` loops to `for...of` loops in `savePageFiles` and `saveScreenshots` functions
  - This was preventing successful Vercel deployments
- **Vercel Deployment**: Linked local project to Vercel for manual deployment capability

### Updated
- Documentation to reflect current deployment status and fixes

## 0.1.0 - 2025-05-22

### Added
- Implemented firecrawl deep scraping for maximum data capture
- Created MCP utilities for firecrawl-mcp-server integration
- Enhanced Prisma schema with comprehensive data models:
  - WebsiteAnalysis model with detailed status tracking
  - WebsitePage model for storing page-specific content
  - WebsiteAsset model for tracking CSS, JavaScript, images, and other assets
  - PerformanceData model for Lighthouse metrics
- Developed advanced data processing utilities:
  - Site map processing with hierarchical structure
  - Content extraction with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript parsing
  - Performance metrics processing from Lighthouse data
  - Structured data extraction using LLM capabilities
- Updated API routes with comprehensive error handling
- Added status checking endpoint for monitoring scraping progress
- Implemented Claude Sonnet-optimized prompt generation
