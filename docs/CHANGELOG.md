## 0.1.3 - 2025-01-15 - Phase 1 Completion (80%)

### Added
- **Enhanced Error Handling & Resume Capability**
  - Exponential backoff retry logic (3 attempts: 2s, 4s, 8s delays)
  - Automatic Firecrawl ‚Üí Puppeteer fallback
  - Resume API endpoint for failed analyses (`/api/resume-analysis`)
  - Structured error responses with actionable suggestions
  - Database progress tracking for failed scans
