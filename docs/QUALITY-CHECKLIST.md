## âœ… Quality Gates

### Before Release:
1. **Generate test package** with known website
2. **Run AI evaluation prompt** (see TESTING-PROTOCOL.md)
3. **Score must be â‰¥ 8/10** for release
4. **Zero BLOCKING issues** allowed

### Quick Visual Check:
- Open screenshots folder â†’ Should see actual images
- Open pages/homepage.html â†’ Should see clean, readable HTML
- Open assets/manifest.json â†’ Should list actual files with URLs
- Open docs/components.md â†’ Should see complete component descriptions

### AI Usability Test:
**Ask yourself: "Could I rebuild this website with just this package?"**
- Can I see what it should look like? (Screenshots)
- Can I understand the styling? (CSS files)
- Can I identify reusable parts? (Components)
- Can I get all the assets? (Asset manifest)

## ðŸŽ¯ Success Criteria
- **Package Quality Score**: 8-10/10
- **AI Reconstruction Feasible**: Yes
- **All Critical Assets Present**: Yes
- **Visual Reference Complete**: Yes

## ðŸš« Failure Indicators
- "No screenshots were captured"
- HTML with no corresponding CSS
- Component analysis with "..." truncation
- Asset manifest with < 50% of actual assets
- AI evaluator says "unusable for reconstruction"

**Remember: If an AI can't rebuild the site with our package, we've failed our core mission.**
