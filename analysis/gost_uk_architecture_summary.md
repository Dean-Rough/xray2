# Website Architecture Summary: gost.uk

## 1. Page Hierarchy, Depths, and Internal Linking

Based on the sitemap generated by Firecrawl, the website `https://gost.uk` has a relatively flat structure. Key top-level pages include:

*   Homepage (`/`)
*   Menus (`/menus`)
*   Gallery (`/gallery`)
*   Contact (`/contact`)
*   Reservations (`/reservations`)
*   Xmas (`/xmas`) - Likely seasonal.
*   Interior Design (`/interior-design`)

A significant portion of the site consists of blog posts, accessible directly (e.g., `/best-steak-restaurant-in-glasgow-come-and-try-us`) and through author/category/tag archive pages.

*   **Page Depths:**
    *   Main pages are at depth 1.
    *   Blog posts are typically at depth 1 or 2 (if accessed via category/tag pages).
    *   Paginated archives (e.g., `/author/deanrough-ink/page/2`) go to depth 2+.

*   **Internal Linking Patterns:**
    *   Navigation menus (inferred from common links like "Skip to content", "reserve a table", "view the menus" appearing across scraped pages) likely provide primary site-wide linking.
    *   Blog posts likely link to each other and to category/tag pages.
    *   Call-to-action buttons (e.g., "reserve a table", "view the menus") link to key conversion pages.

## 2. Global UI Components

Detecting global UI components (headers, footers, navigation) precisely requires DOM hash comparison, which was not performed by the tools used. However, based on the scraped markdown content:

*   A "Skip to content" link appears consistently, suggesting a common accessibility feature in a header.
*   Links to "Reservations" and "Menus" appear frequently, indicating they might be part of a global navigation or footer.
*   The overall page structure (e.g., main content area) seems consistent across the scraped pages.

It's highly probable that the site uses a consistent header (with navigation and logo) and a footer (with contact information, social links, etc.) across most pages.

## 3. Third-Party Scripts and CDNs

Based on the Lighthouse reports (specifically from the homepage analysis), the following third-party services and CDNs are in use:

*   **Typekit (Adobe Fonts):**
    *   `use.typekit.net`
    *   `p.typekit.net`
*   **Google Fonts:**
    *   `fonts.googleapis.com`
    *   `fonts.gstatic.com`
*   **Elfsight (Widgets/Plugins):**
    *   `elfsight.com`
    *   `files.elfsightcdn.com` (Used for serving PDF menus)
*   **Facebook:**
    *   `connect.facebook.net` (Likely for social plugins or tracking pixels)

These services contribute to the site's functionality, typography, and potentially marketing/analytics.
