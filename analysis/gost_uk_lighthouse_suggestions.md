# Lighthouse Improvement Suggestions: gost.uk

This document summarizes key performance, accessibility, best practices, and SEO improvement suggestions based on Lighthouse audit reports for `https://gost.uk`. Scores are out of 1 (or 100 if multiplied).

## Overall Performance Observations:

Across the audited pages (Homepage, Menus, Gallery, Blog Post), there are common themes:

*   **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP):** Generally high (e.g., Homepage: 7.1s, Menus: 7.9s, Gallery: 9.9s, Blog: 3.2s). This is a critical area for improvement as it significantly impacts user-perceived load speed.
*   **First Contentful Paint (FCP):** Also higher than ideal (e.g., Homepage: 3.0s, Menus: 3.5s, Gallery: 3.2s, Blog: 2.4s).
*   **Speed Index:** Moderate to high (e.g., Homepage: 3.6s, Menus: 4.1s, Gallery: 5.0s, Blog: 2.4s).
*   **Time to Interactive (TTI):** Can be quite high, especially on image-heavy pages (e.g., Homepage: 7.3s, Menus: 8.0s, Gallery: 10.4s, Blog: 3.2s).
*   **Total Blocking Time (TBT):** Generally low, which is good, indicating not too many long tasks blocking the main thread after FCP.

## Key Improvement Areas & Suggestions:

### 1. Optimize Images (High Impact)

*   **Serve images in next-gen formats (e.g., WebP, AVIF):** All reports show significant potential savings here. This can drastically reduce file sizes without sacrificing quality.
    *   *Example (Homepage):* Potential savings of several seconds if images are converted.
*   **Efficiently encode images:** Further optimize existing JPEGs and PNGs.
*   **Properly size images:** Serve images at the dimensions they are displayed to avoid sending unnecessarily large files.
    *   *Example (Gallery):* Many large images are likely being scaled down by CSS.
*   **Defer offscreen images (Lazy Loading):** Implement lazy loading for images below the fold. This was flagged on multiple pages.
*   **Preload Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) image:** If the LCP element is an image, preloading it can improve LCP time.

### 2. Reduce Unused JavaScript and CSS (Medium-High Impact)

*   **Reduce unused JavaScript:** Reports indicate potential savings by removing or splitting JS bundles.
    *   *Example (Homepage & Menus):* Potential savings of a few hundred kilobytes.
*   **Reduce unused CSS:** Similar to JS, identify and remove or defer non-critical CSS.
    *   *Example (Gallery & Blog):* Potential savings noted.
*   **Minify CSS and JavaScript:** Ensure all CSS and JS files are minified.

### 3. Eliminate Render-Blocking Resources (Medium-High Impact)

*   Identify CSS and JavaScript files that are blocking the first paint of your page.
*   Consider inlining critical CSS/JS or deferring non-critical resources.
    *   *Example (All pages):* Multiple render-blocking resources were identified, including Typekit CSS and plugin CSS/JS.

### 4. Server Response Time (TTFB)

*   **Initial server response time was short:** This is generally good across the board (e.g., Homepage: 20ms, Menus: 20ms, Gallery: 20ms, Blog: 330ms - blog slightly higher but still acceptable). Maintain this or look for minor optimizations if possible, especially for the blog.

### 5. Font Loading

*   **All text remains visible during webfont loads (`font-display`):** This is generally passing, which is good. Ensure `font-display: swap;` or similar is used for web fonts to prevent invisible text.

### 6. Accessibility (Generally Good, Minor Points)

*   **Overall Scores:** Accessibility scores are generally high (often 0.9+).
*   **Areas for Review (examples from various reports):**
    *   Ensure all images have appropriate `alt` text (flagged on Gallery).
    *   Check color contrast ratios for some text elements.
    *   Ensure form elements have associated labels (seen on Blog comment form).
    *   Logical heading order.

### 7. Best Practices (Generally Good)

*   **Uses HTTPS:** Passing.
*   **No browser errors logged to the console:** Generally passing, which is excellent.
*   **Avoids deprecated APIs:** Passing.

### 8. SEO (Generally Good, Minor Points)

*   **Overall Scores:** SEO scores are generally high (often 0.9+).
*   **Areas for Review (examples from various reports):**
    *   Ensure all pages have a meta description (Blog post was missing one or it was not effective).
    *   Ensure links have descriptive text.
    *   Ensure all anchors are crawlable.

## Console Error Frequency:

The Lighthouse reports generally indicate "No browser errors logged to the console," which is a positive sign. For a more in-depth analysis of console error frequency, continuous monitoring with browser developer tools during typical user journeys or using a dedicated error tracking service would be necessary. The current snapshot audits are clean.

## Recommendations for Rebuild:

*   **Prioritize Image Optimization:** This will likely yield the largest performance gains. Implement a robust image pipeline using Next.js's `next/image` component for automatic optimization, resizing, and format conversion.
*   **Code Splitting & Lazy Loading:** Next.js handles much of this automatically for JS. Ensure components and non-critical CSS are also considered for lazy loading or conditional loading.
*   **Critical CSS:** Inline critical CSS for faster initial render.
*   **Font Loading Strategy:** Continue using `font-display: swap` and consider preloading key font files.
*   **Accessibility Audit:** While scores are good, manually review against WCAG guidelines, especially for interactive elements and forms.
*   **SEO Basics:** Ensure all pages have unique and descriptive titles and meta descriptions.

By addressing these areas, particularly LCP and FCP through image and resource loading optimization, the rebuilt site should see significant performance improvements.
